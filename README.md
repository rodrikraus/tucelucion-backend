# E-Commerce Backend Application

This is a **Spring Boot** backend application designed for the company **"TuCelucion"** e-commerce system. It includes REST APIs, database integration, server-side rendering with Thymeleaf, and containerization with Docker. The application is currently **deployed on Google Cloud** and **Azure** and integrates with **Supabase** as the backend database.

## 📦 Core Technologies

### 🧠 Backend Framework
- **Spring Boot 3.4.5** – Main application framework
- **Spring Web** – REST API and web layer
- **Spring Data JPA** – Simplified database access using repositories
- **Spring Boot DevTools** – Hot-reload and other development-time features

### 💻 Programming Language
- **Java 17** – Using Eclipse Temurin JDK

### 🗃️ Database & ORM
- **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** – Fully managed PostgreSQL database via Supabase
- **Hibernate** – ORM framework via Spring Data JPA
- **HikariCP** – High-performance JDBC connection pooling

### 🧩 Build & Dependency Management
- **Maven** – Build automation and dependency management
- **Maven Wrapper** – Ensures consistent builds across environments

### 🖥️ Template Engine
- **Thymeleaf** – Server-side rendering of HTML templates

### 📚 Additional Libraries
